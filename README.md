## Description

Exploration game in which a small robot is sent into space to repair a spaceship. Manage the power to propel the robot. Take care: propulsion costs power, which can be retrieved automatically (slowly) or instantly by taking bonuses.
Avoid collisions with neaby asteroids, and don't waste your time!

## How to play

Mouse only. Press left button and move the mouse to adjust the propulsion power and angle. Release button to fire the rocket. 
Reach the spaceship fragments and stop on them to grab. Bring them back to the ship and stop on their corresponding location to replace them.

## About the game

Made in a couple of days time during holidays. Graphics and music by my son. We reused and updated the character that we introduced in our Gamedev.js 2023 game.
